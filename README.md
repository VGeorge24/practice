Georges commit

Add the repo to your computer. 
Open the repo in visual studio code. 
Open the terminal and type - 'git branch <name of branch>' to create a new branch
Type - 'git checkout <name of branch>' to go to the branch. 
Make changes you want to make. 
Type 'git add .' to add all changes
Type 'git commit -m "Message"' to commit the changes. 
Type 'git push --set-upstream origin <name of branch>' 

Now go on github, you will see a pull request wanting to merge the two branches. We can use this to review the changes before pulling them into the main branch.
